# Thesis Project: Monte-Carlo Algorithm in Technical Debt Prioritization.

This repository contains the implementation and documentation of my thesis project, which focuses on the prioritization of technical debt elements within a software project using the Monte-Carlo algorithm. The goal of this project is to simulate technical debt refactorings, compute the payoff value associated with those refactorings, and choose the best refactoring option that optimizes resource management and software quality.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this thesis project is to address the challenge of managing technical debt in software development by providing a systematic approach for prioritizing and addressing technical debt elements. The Monte-Carlo algorithm is utilized as the core methodology for decision-making in this context.

The project consists of the following components:

1. Monte-Carlo Algorithm Implementation: The core implementation of the Monte-Carlo algorithm is developed to simulate technical debt refactorings. It considers various factors such as complexity, maintenance effort, and potential impact on software quality when prioritizing refactoring options.

2. Payoff Value Computation: The project incorporates a mechanism to compute the payoff value associated with each refactoring option. This value is determined by considering factors such as resource utilization, improved software quality, enhanced maintainability, and long-term impact on the project.
